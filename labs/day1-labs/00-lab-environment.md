# Lab Environment

## Classroom Setting

These labs are designed for delivery in a classroom. For these labs we require a Linux-based VM in Azure as a "jumpbox". The first task here is to create this virtual machine and install the required software on it.

Our labs are build and verified using CentOS7. Our recommendations is to use CentOS7. 

### Setup Environment

* **Setup your Jumpbox VM in Azure**
    1. Browse to http://portal.azure.com
    2. Click on "Create a resource" and search for "CentOS-based 7.5"
    3. Deploy the CentOS-based 7.5 VM  
    
         Size: D2s_v3 (Please don't use B-series VMs)
    
         Publisher: Rogue Wave Software
    
         NSG Rule: Allow inbound on SSH port (22) 
                  
         Public IP: Yes
         
         Authentication: Provide a strong password or use public-key authentication(recommended) for your Jumpbox because it's accessible publicly.
    
    
    4. After the CentOS jumbbox is provisioned in Azure, you can connect to it using SSH (PuTTY or MobaXTerm - or nativly using the "ssh" command in PowerShell)
    **Verify that Auto-Shutdown has been disabled for this VM** 
    5. Connect to your newly created jumpbox on the Public IP
    6. Goto [**Jumpbox Setup**](/labs/helper-files/jumpbox-setup.md) to install the required software that you'll need for this training.

* **Setup Azure Cloud Shell:** 

    1. Browse to http://portal.azure.com
    2. Login with the Azure credentials
    3. Click on the cloud shell icon to start your session.
